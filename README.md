## Simple Localisation Testing.

Sometimes you don't want to go through the hassle of changing your device or Mac
settings just to test a localisation.

Well, through the magic of Xcode build schemes and runtime arguments you don't
have to.

This is the example to go with the explanation at
http://abizern.org/2012/03/18/simple-localisation-testing/. It demonstrates:

- Setting up Schemes to run localisations quickly without having to change
machine settings.
- An Xcode workspace with multiple projects and shared images.
- Pictures of tasty food.

Really? This is just a demo. But since I'm using some Creative-Commons images, I
suppose that will do. So cc-by it is. But basically - don't be a dick.
